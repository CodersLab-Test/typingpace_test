The project enables testing your typing skills. 
Simple structure of the file and its style serve this aim.
Once you open index.html file in the browser, you'll see short instruction.
Follow it to test the pace of typing.
Thirty-word-long text to be typed is generated randomly from a string of more than 830 Polish words.
Once the user starts typing, the current time is checked and when they press the Done button,
the time is checked again. The difference (along with the number of words) 
is used to calculate the pace of typing.
Then, the words in the text are compared to those typed by the user.
Corresponding message is generated for the user as a feedback, e.g.:
"You typed at 30 words per minute.
20 words correct out of 30." 

This app can be open and works on mobile devices' brosers; 
however typing on the phone virtual keyboard differs significantly from this activity on the proper device (e.g. laptop or PC). 
Keep this in mind.
